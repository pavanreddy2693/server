# Deploying a Triton Inference Server

The Triton Inference Server project is designed for flexibility and
allows developers to create and deploy inferencing solutions in a
variety of ways. Developers can deploy Triton as an http server, a
grpc server, a server supporting both, or embed a Triton server into
their own application. Developers can deploy Triton locally or in the
cloud, within a kubernetes cluster, behind an API gateway or as a
standalone process.  This guide is intended to provide some key points
and best practices that users deploying Triton based solutions should
consider.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ultimately the security of a solution based on Triton
> is the responsibility of the developer building and deploying that
> solution.
